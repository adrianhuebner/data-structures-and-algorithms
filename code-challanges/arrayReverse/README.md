# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function that takes an array as an argument, without using any built in methods return that array in a reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

-Worked with Julie on this White Boarding challenge
  - We created a hard coded array
  - Then we created a function that takes in array of strings as argument 
  - In that function create a for loop starting in the last position and moving left by decrimenting 
  - We only wanted to go as far as the midpoint 
  - Assigned two variables for the first and the last positions in the Array
    - Swap those two positions with each other
  - Return array in it's reverse order
  - Call the function with array of strings as argument
