# Hashtables

## Challenge

Our challenge for this was to create a hashtable, that contains the ability to hash, add, get the value based off a key, and return a boolean if a key exists in the table

## Approach & Efficiency

- Add:
  - Space: O(1)
  - Time: O(1)

- Get:
  - Space: O(1)
  - Time: O(1)

- Contains:
  - Space: O(1)
  - Time: O(1)

- Hash:
  - Space: O(1)
  - Time: O(1)

## API

- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
